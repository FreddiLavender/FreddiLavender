# My Journey to Data & Analytics # 

My passion for Data & Analytics began in secondary school, where I enjoyed scientific studies such as Biology and Physics. I particularly enjoyed Biology due to the creative side of calculus - including biodiversity calculations which ultimately showed the diversity of organisms in different regions which allowed me to further investigate related topics including ecosystems, hierachy systems and much more! It was from here that I knew I had a passion for Data & Analytics, but I also loved the creative side of calculus too. 

From here, I attended university to study Biology. I continued my studies into Data & Analytics and had opportunities to use programming languages such as RStudio and SPSS, alongside visualisation software such as MATLAB. My passions continued into my Master's degree within Statistics. It was here that I discovered tools such as Python and SQL whilst exploring visualisation software such as PowerBI and Tableau. 

# My Professional Career # 

After completing my Master's degree, I moved into Data Recruitment to further explore my analytical skills and hugely improve my communication with both internal and external clients. I quickly found a passion for working alongside Data professionals, often finding common ground due to our passion regarding particular tools. It was from here that I have found my current position within my current organisation as an Internal Talent Sourcer. Here, I recruit the best talent into our consultancy whilst also carrying out internal analytics for the business too. I have worked with SQL, Excel and PowerBI. 

# Future Ambitions and Goals #

At my current organisation, I will be joining the Analytics team in September as a Junior Analyst. Here, I will improve my technical skills and have the chance to work with a variety of clients, solving their technical issues using my understanding of tools and best practices. I endeavour to become a Data Engineer / Analytics Engineer specialising in SQL and Python in my future career.
